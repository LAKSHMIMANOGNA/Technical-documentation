1.1 History of git  
The Linux kernel is an open source software project of fairly large scope. For most of the lifetime of the Linux kernel maintenance (1991â€“2002), changes to the software were passed around as patches and archived files. In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper.
